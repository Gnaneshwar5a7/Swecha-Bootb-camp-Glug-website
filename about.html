            <h2>About Swecha</h2>
            <p>Swecha was founded in 2005 as an organisation to support the <a
                    href="https://swecha.org/content/swecha-project" target="_self" title="Swecha Project">Swecha
                    project</a>, it is now a vibrant community of software users, students, academicians and software
                professionals/developers determined to provide quality software built on the guidelines of free software
                development model. </p>
            <p>Swecha aims at providing global software solutions to the local people with the Free Software development
                model by working together with the community of developers and users all over. The prime objective of <a
                    href="https://swecha.org/content/swecha-project" target="_self" title="Swecha Project">Swecha OS</a>
                is to provide a complete computing solution to a population that speaks and understands only Telugu.
            </p>
            <p>The project aims at bridging the gap between the computer technology that exists predominantly in English
                and the Telugu-speaking community of India. The project also aims at providing a framework for
                development and maintenance of Free Software projects taken up by the community.</p>
            <div class="content">
                <p><a href="https://www.swecha.org/"><strong>Swecha</strong></a> is a project aimed at coming out with a
                    localised version of <a href="http://www.gnu.org.in/">GNU/Linux</a> in Telugu. The target users of
                    the distro being the entire community that is a prey of the digital divide. This project helps in
                    coming out with a solution for the digital divide and allows the possibility of digital unite
                    becoming a reality.</p>
                <p><strong>Commencement of the Project:</strong></p>
                <p>The objective being clear the project had a beginning with the preparation of the task list. The
                    prime area of work was having a Telugu font under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU
                        GPL</a>. There was not any font available then, it was essential that we had to work out our own
                    font.</p>
                <p><strong>The font work:</strong></p>
                <p>Beginning with the font work was an interesting task, complete software necessary for developing
                    fonts was not available in <a href="http://www.gnu.org.in/">GNU/Linux</a>.<a
                        href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/"> Fontforge</a> the current software then called as
                    pfaedit was the only choice. Fontforge was still in the developing stage, we had two choices for the
                    completion of the work. First, to develop a font using proprietary software and announce it as a
                    font released under GPL. Second, work in co-ordination with the developers of Fontforge and discuss
                    with them to get the necessary features ( popular method that is followed by the entire community).
                    We preferred the way community works and understood the real sense of team work devoid of time and
                    space. We in-fact could learn this new method of working in co-ordination with people across the
                    globe working with a common motive. Completion of one font that suits the total requirements
                    accelerated the pace of the project.</p>
                <p><strong>Preparation of the glossary:</strong></p>
                <p>With the completion of the font, a glossary on which there can be a consensus was the immediate need
                    to proceed with localisation. The aim of the glossary was to have a homogeneous set of vocabulary.
                    Preparation of the glossary was done with the help of friends working as journalists. The
                    translations were done based on the dictionaries provided by Telugu Academy. The target users of the
                    localised versions being the people deprived as a result of digital divide, the vocabulary chosen
                    was also targeted at their usage. Translation of some of the words was a bit critical, we decided to
                    go ahead by having feedback from the real users across the state.</p>
                <p><strong>Translation of files:</strong> The tanslation of files is being done with a co-ordination
                    from people who geographically at different places. There is a team being set up to srutinise the
                    translations and submit them to the repository.</p>
                <p><strong>The first release :</strong><br> With the completion of the glossary the entire process of
                    translation was geared up. We chose the basic applications needed by a user and translated the
                    applications along with the basic user interface, and the test release was done on 08-02-05 by the
                    Honorable Chief Minister of AP Dr Y.S.Rajasekhara Reddy in the presence of the Free Software
                    Foundation founder and chairman <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard M Stallman</a>.</p>
